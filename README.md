# Home-Automation-using-Hand-Gestures

## Objective
This project is aim towards building a Gesture Based Home automation solution

##About the Project
Gesture based home automation using Arduino, Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe is a combination of technologies that can be used to create a smart home. Arduino can be used to build a system that can detect and interpret gestures. Python can be used to program the system and OpenCV can be used to recognize gestures. Mediapipe can be used to create a virtual assistant that can respond to gestures and provide feedback. With these technologies, you can create a home automation system that responds to gestures, enabling you to control your home with a wave of your hand.
